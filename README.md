## DeveloperWarRoom Overview
The DeveloperWarRoom project is an open source chrome extension built as a senior project for Portland State University's Capstone class. The extension, built using React, aims to support developers by being a single point of view for ongoing projects and requirements. The extension is built to be modular and easily extensible with the core module being a widget (i.e. a React component) that acts as mini-application. Example widgets are: a todo list, a Github pull request monitor, a quick-links tab (aka bookmarks), and a reddit front page overview. The extension allows the user to add / remove / rearrange widgets in a grid-like fashion. See this [preview](https://github.com/marcellabillett/DeveloperWarRoom/wiki/Features) for an illustration of the extension.

so that anyone may add a widget (i.e. a react component) that provides some additional functionality users might find useful.
